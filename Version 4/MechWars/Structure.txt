How I want it structured is that.  

Pick faction type 
	List all files with ML
	Make it so each ML has a button to press that activates it. 
	After picking the ML, it loads in all the correct files for each equipment .txt listed in the file.   

Once faction type is picked, allow the player to choose the enemy in the same manner.  
	There are two exceptions, the player can pick any enemy.
